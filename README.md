Open World Simulator
====
Open World Simulator is an open source project aiming at creating a computer model of multiple aspects of the world's economy, demography, environmental, energy and social behaviours. 
This will be achieved by the application of agent based simulation, aiming at identifying and experimenting with emergent 
behaviours arising from the agent's decisions.

This long term project will be developed on an iterative, incremental way, with simplicity in mind and minimizing the amount of technical complexities.
